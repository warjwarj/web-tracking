Needs Node.js and MongoDB (Atlas) to run

When cloned install dependancies with 'npm i' in root directory

Do 'npm run devstart' to start server, default port 3000

TODO:

 -

 - get SSL cert

 - implement user scope = CMS like tree structure

 - COMPANY (mongo) DOCUMENTS ^^ TIE INTO USER SCOPE

 - data is weighed last before sending to client, offers customisability

 - (driverscore) could take mean avg of bottom x in all fleets and top x for clients that want an industry wide avg instead of fleet/company wide. (discard if outside of range take that val as bottom/top end of scale)

 - register companys

 - automate as much of the data storage as possible (as little processing upon client request as possible)

 - weightconfig needs to be in company scope, manager + admin can change
